- Background color: Soft pale rose (#F1FAEE), near white but still in the crimson hue range for consistency.
- Accent color: Deep mauve (#A8DADC), an analogous color used sparingly for a distinctive call-to-action.
- Font pairing: 'Playfair' (serif) for headlines, 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) for body text to maintain a modern, clean aesthetic with a hint of elegance.
- Use minimalist icons for the bottom navigation and other UI elements to enhance the modern and clean look.
- Maintain a fixed bottom navigation bar with clear icons and labels for easy access to main sections.
- Subtle transitions and animations to enhance user experience when navigating between tabs and interacting with elements.
